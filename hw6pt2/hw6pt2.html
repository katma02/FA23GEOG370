    <h1>Homework 6 Part 2: Ratios and Categories Census Data</h1>
    <h2>Kat Anderson</h2>
    <h3> This choropleth shows the percentage of households in Montana that have an estimated annual income of less than $50,000. To create the percentage, I normalized the number of households with incomes under $50,000 with the total number of households in each county. This data was collected by the American Community Survey from 2017 to 2021, and is now accessible on the U.S. Census Bureau website.</h3>
