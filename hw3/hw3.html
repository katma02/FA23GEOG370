   <h1>Homework 3</h1>
   <h2>In this exercise, I learned how to display maps in different projections using QGIS.</h2>
    <h3>To display this world map in different projections, I first uploaded the shapefile into QGIS. After that, I installed the Indicatrix mapper plugin by clicking the "manage and install plugins" button in the toolbar. Then I ran the plugin by using the button in the upper left hand corner, which provided the circles that show distortion on the map. To change the CRS, I searched for the EPSG number on the CRS tab of the project properties window and applied the one I wanted. Once I had the map, I created a new print layout where I labeled the map and saved it as a png to display on this site.</h3>

    <h2>WGS 84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This rectangular projection retains the features of area and shape on the equator, but stretches moving North or South.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection curves the map around what looks like part of a globe. The farther away from the prime meridian and equator, the more distorted and larger the countries are.</h3>

    <h2>EPSG: 3857 - Pseudo-Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>This rectangular projection maintains shape and direction, but area is distorted moving away from the equator going North or South.</h3>

    <h2>EPSG: 53018 - Winkel I Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is more ellipsoid-shaped, and strikes a balance between shape distortion and size distortion.</h3>

    <h2>EPSG: 54034 Projection - World Cylindrical Equal Area</h2>
    <h3>This map was made by wrapping a cylinder around the globe. The North and South of the globe are very stretched out, while the equator is the closest to being truly represented..</h3>

    <h2>EPSG: 54027 - World Equidistant Conic Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map was made by wrapping a cone around a portion of the globe. The parts of the map equivalent to the bottom of the cone are larger and misshapen than at the top of the cone.</h3>

    <h2>EPSG: 102016 - North Pole Azimuthal Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map was made by projecting part of the globe around a chosen point, here the north pole, to create a circular map. Farther away from the north pole, both shape and area are distorted. </h3>

    <h2>EPSG: 54008 - World Sinusoidal Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection minimizes distortion at the equator, but the North and South of the map are strangely shaped and too large.</h3>
    <img width="500" src="./maps/54008.png" alt="">

    <h2>EPSG: 54030 - World Robinson Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map compromises between shape and area distortion, and gets more distorted away from both the equator and the prime meridian.</h3>
