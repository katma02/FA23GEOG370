    <h1>Homework 8: Geoprocessing analysis</h1>
    <h2>Kat Anderson</h2>
    <h3>I'm a geology major, so I wanted to look at active mining permits in North Carolina, because active mining often has negative environmental consequences. I wanted to see how many permits were within a mile of Natural Areas designated by the NC Natural Heritage Program, which are noted for their importance in conserving biodiversity in the state. I decided to anwer the question "What percent of active mining permits in NC are within 1 mile of a Natural Heritage Natural Area?". </h3>
    <h3>To answer this question, I first downloaded an NC boundaries shapefile, an active mining permits shapefile from the NCDEQ, and the Natural Heritage Natural Areas (NHNA) shapefile from their website. I then buffered the NHNA shapefile by 1 mile and did an intersection with the buffered layer and the mining points to create a layer of points inside the buffered area. I was determined that out of 2305 active permits, 1575 of them are within a mile of a NHNA, or 68.33%.</h3>
