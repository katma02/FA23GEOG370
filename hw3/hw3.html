   <h1>Homework 3</h1>
   <h2>In this exercise, I learned how to display maps in different projections using QGIS.</h2>
    <h3>description paragraph here</h3>

    <h2>WGS 84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>observations</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>observations</h3>
    <img width="500" src="/hw3/maps/54043.png" alt="">

    <h2>EPSG: 3857 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This rectangular projection maintains shape and direction, but distorts the area of the North and South.</h3>
    <img width="500" src="/hw3/maps/3857.png" alt="">

    <h2>EPSG: 53018 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is more rounded, and strikes a balance between shape distortion and size distortion.</h3>

    <h2>EPSG: 54034 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This was made by wrapping a cylinder around the globe. The North and South of the globe are very stretched out, while the equator is the closest to being truly represented..</h3>

    <h2>EPSG: 54027 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map was made by wrapping a cone around a portion of the globe, leaving a cutout because the map is shaped like a circle. The parts of the map equivalent to the bottom of the cone are larger and more stretched than at the top of the cone.</h3>

    <h2>EPSG: 102016</h2>
    <h3>This was made by projecting part of the globe around a chosen point, here the north pole, to create a circular map. Farther away from the north pole, the map is both stretched and larger. </h3>
    <img width="500" src="/hw3/maps/102016.png" alt="">

    <h2>EPSG: 54008</h2>
    <h3>This projection minimizes distortion at the equator, but the North and South of the map are strangely stretched and too large.</h3>
    <img width="500" src="/hw3/maps/54008.png" alt="">

    <h2>EPSG: 54030 </h2>
    <h3>This map compromises between shape and area distortion, and gets more distorted away from both the equator and the prime meridian.</h3>
